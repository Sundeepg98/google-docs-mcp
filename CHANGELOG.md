# Changelog

All notable changes to `google-docs-mcp`.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.1.3] — 2026-05-18

Closes "verify the test_suite block isn't just a number to trust"
gap. Three additions that make the suite independently verifiable.

### Added

- **`test_suite.ci_run_url`** — link to the GitHub Actions run that
  produced this artifact. Populated by `deploy.sh` via best-effort
  `gh run list --commit=<sha>`; empty string if no run found
  (deploy ran before CI completed, gh not installed, etc.).

- **`test_suite.report_digest`** — sha256 of the canonicalized
  `test-results.json` payload (excluding the `_meta` block itself,
  chicken-and-egg). Stored in `_meta.digest` in the JSON file at
  deploy time; recomputed by the server at read time and compared.

- **`test_suite.status: "tampered"`** — new status value emitted
  when the recomputed digest doesn't match the stored one. Catches
  post-build edits to the artifact's `summary` (e.g. someone hand-
  editing the passed count). The status hierarchy is now:
  - `unknown`: artifact missing or summary empty (SKIP_TESTS path)
  - `tampered`: stored digest doesn't match recomputed digest
  - `failed`: any test failed
  - `passed`: all green AND digest verifies

- **`gdocs_test_manifest()` MCP tool** — surfaces the test inventory
  + per-test outcomes from the CI artifact. Returns:
  ```
  {
    status: "ok" | "unknown" | "tampered",
    total: int,
    tests: [{nodeid, outcome}, ...],
    named_regression_guards: {present: [...], missing: [...]},
  }
  ```
  Lets any caller confirm specific named guards (e.g.
  `test_owned_by_app_agrees_with_trash_outcome`) actually exist and
  passed — instead of trusting an opaque "203". Tool count: 20 → 21.

### Fixed

- **Lazy cwd evaluation in `_find_test_results_path`** — was
  computing candidates at module-load time, freezing the working
  directory. Caught by `test_test_suite_status_tampered_when_digest_
  mismatches` which monkeypatches `chdir`. Now evaluated at each
  call.

### Tests

- `test_canonical_digest_excludes_meta_block_and_is_stable` — same
  payload in different dict-iteration orders → identical digest;
  tampering changes the digest.
- `test_test_suite_status_tampered_when_digest_mismatches` — the
  killer guard: edit summary.passed without re-signing → server
  reports status="tampered".
- `test_gdocs_test_manifest_exists_and_returns_required_shape` —
  manifest tool returns the documented shape regardless of artifact
  presence.
- All 21 tool's `test_tool_descriptions_truthful` and
  `test_tool_input_schema_non_empty` extended to the new tool
  (gdocs_test_manifest joins no_args allowlist).

Total: 210 unit + 6 live tests, all green.

### Deferred to v1.2.0

- **CI mutation testing stage** — automated proof that injected
  regressions turn their named test red. Substantial CI workflow
  changes; separate atomic commit. The manual adversarial test
  (branch + PR #8) already proved the loop works on file_id; the
  v1.2 work is automating that across all 8 named guards on every
  build.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-05-18

### Added

- **`gdocs_server_info.test_suite` block** — surfaces CI status of
  the running build over the MCP interface. Before this, the
  CI-gated test suite existed in the repo but its pass/fail state
  was invisible to anyone using the deployed server; the only way
  to confirm "the running build was actually tested" was to re-run
  behaviors by hand — the exact toil the suite was built to
  eliminate.

  Wire-up:
  - `deploy.sh` runs `pytest tests/unit --json-report --json-report-file=test-results.json`
    via `pytest-json-report`, then injects `_git_commit` into the JSON.
  - `Dockerfile` COPIes `test-results.json` into the image (uses
    the `test-results.jso[n]` glob trick so vanilla `docker build`
    without deploy.sh doesn't fail).
  - `gdocs_server_info` reads + returns:
    ```
    test_suite: {
        last_run: ISO 8601 UTC,
        commit:   git SHA the suite ran against,
        passed:   int,
        failed:   int,
        skipped:  int,
        status:   "passed" | "failed" | "unknown",
    }
    ```
  - If the file's missing or unparseable (vanilla docker build,
    SKIP_TESTS=1, malformed JSON), returns `{"status": "unknown"}`
    per the documented contract — the field is always present.
  - `test_suite.commit` should equal the top-level `git_commit`;
    divergence means the image shipped without a matching test
    run, a red flag worth surfacing.

  Test dependency added: `pytest-json-report>=1.5` (optional;
  only used at deploy time).

  Guard: `test_server_info.py::test_server_info_includes_test_suite_block`.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-18

Post-1.1.0 hot-fixes from the first real cloud-chat user testing.
Each was caught in production by the user noticing mid-use; v1.1.1
adds named unit-test regression guards for every one so the next
cycle catches them in CI.

### Fixed

- **Apps Script `deployments.create` rejected the `entryPoints` field.**
  Google's API returns `Invalid JSON payload received. Unknown name
  "entryPoints": Cannot find field.` Web-app entry-point configuration
  belongs in the `appsscript.json` manifest, NOT the deployment body.
  Removed `entryPoints` from `deploy_webapp`'s request body; removed
  the now-unused `execute_as` / `access` parameters from its signature.
  Guard: `test_gas_deploy.py::test_deploy_webapp_body_does_not_include_entryPoints`.

- **Apps Script Web App manifest changed `access: MYSELF` →
  `ANYONE_ANONYMOUS`.** In single-tenant v1.0 the operator was both
  deployer and runtime caller, so `MYSELF` worked via session magic.
  In v1.1 multi-tenant cloud, the USER deploys the Web App but the
  SERVER calls it — unauthenticated. `MYSELF` would 401 every call.
  `ANYONE_ANONYMOUS` is the right setting for the v1.1 architecture.
  Surface is bounded by the script's logic (only acts on doc IDs in
  the request, only on docs the deployer owns); v1.2 will add HMAC
  request validation for defense in depth.

- **OAuth callback failed on Fly with `OAuth 2 MUST utilize https`.**
  Fly terminates TLS at the edge; inside the container `request.url`
  has scheme `http://` even though the public URL is HTTPS.
  `oauthlib.Flow.fetch_token` validates the URL and rejected any
  http://. Fixed by rewriting the scheme on the URL we hand to oauthlib
  when `base_url` begins with `https://`. Did NOT set
  `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1` (that disables transport security
  globally).

- **PKCE handling was non-deterministic; callback failed with
  `Missing code verifier`.** Auth URLs sometimes included
  `code_challenge` and sometimes didn't, depending on which Flow code
  path generated them. v1.1.1 makes PKCE always-on: every
  `build_authorization_url` call generates a `code_verifier` via
  `secrets.token_urlsafe(48)`, persists it server-side keyed by the
  state token's nonce (see `oauth_state._pending_verifiers`), and
  retrieves it on callback so `Flow.fetch_token` can complete the
  exchange. Guard:
  `test_oauth_google.py::test_auth_pkce_consistency_every_url`.

- **Doc-string overpromise: tools claimed to work "without setup".**
  `gdocs_setup_apps_script`'s description conflated two prerequisites:
  (a) the Apps Script Web App setup itself, (b) the base Google OAuth
  grant. Other tools don't need (a) but ALL tools need (b). Saying
  "works without setup" unqualified misled the model into trying calls
  that returned `needs_authorization`. Rewrote to distinguish the two
  grant types explicitly. Guard:
  `test_tool_schemas.py::test_tool_descriptions_truthful`.

- **`gdocs_reset_authorization` was registered but undiscoverable via
  `tool_search`.** Tool was visible in `gdocs_server_info.tools` (count
  20) but search ranker couldn't surface its schema for keywords like
  "reset authorization" / "revoke grant" / "sign out". Root cause:
  bland leading description sentence. Rewrote to embed the synonym
  set ("reset / revoke / clear stored Google OAuth credentials. Force
  re-consent.") in the first 200 chars where the ranker weighs most.
  Guard: `test_tool_schemas.py::test_tool_discoverability_via_server_info`.

### Added

- **`gdocs_reset_authorization` MCP tool.** Clears the user's stored
  Google OAuth credentials and (optionally with `full=True`) Apps
  Script setup state. Forces the next tool call back into the
  `needs_authorization` flow. Required as a recovery path AND as the
  only way to re-trigger consent for testing PKCE / scope changes /
  account switches. Per-user in cloud mode (via user_store); per-
  machine in stdio mode (deletes `~/.google-docs-mcp/token.json`).

- **Version string now embeds the git commit SHA as semver build
  metadata.** `gdocs_server_info` reports `version` as
  `f"{__version__}+{GIT_COMMIT}"` (e.g. `1.1.1+abc1234`) when
  `GIT_COMMIT` env var is set. Every deploy from a distinct commit
  reports a unique version string without requiring a manual
  `pyproject.toml` bump on every hot-fix. Per semver §10 the build-
  metadata segment is informational only and doesn't affect sort.

### Tests

+ ~40 new test cases (parametrized over 20 tools):
- `test_tool_discoverability_via_server_info` — server_info.tools
  matches mcp.list_tools() exactly.
- `test_tool_descriptions_truthful` (parametrized over 19 OAuth-needing
  tools) — no description contains "without setup" / "without
  authorization" unqualified.
- `test_tool_input_schema_non_empty` (parametrized over all 20 tools)
  — every tool's schema has properties or is on the no-args allowlist.
- `test_tab_nesting_depth_cap_enforced` — 4-level nesting raises
  ValueError before any Google API call.
- `test_auth_pkce_consistency_every_url` — 5 sequential calls all
  return URLs with code_challenge + code_challenge_method=S256, all
  with unique challenges (verifier regenerated per call).
- `test_pkce_verifier_roundtrip` (+ 2 related) — sign_state with
  code_verifier → verify_state returns it on consume; single-use;
  no-PKCE returns None for backward compat.

Total: ~200 unit + 4 live tests. CI gates deploys on unit pass via
`deploy.sh`.

### Internal

- Auto version-bump-on-deploy wired via the GIT_COMMIT build arg in
  `deploy.sh`. Every push to Fly carries a unique build identifier.
- GitHub Actions runs the full unit suite across Python 3.10–3.13 on
  every push/PR.
- `deploy.sh` runs `pytest tests/unit -q` before `flyctl deploy`;
  refuses to deploy on test failure (bypassable with `SKIP_TESTS=1`
  for emergency hot-fixes).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-18

**Multi-tenant cloud auth.** The remote HTTP MCP (claude.ai connector
via Fly.io) is now genuinely multi-tenant — each cloud-chat user
operates on their *own* Drive with their *own* Google identity. Before
1.1, the entire Fly deployment was single-tenant: every cloud-chat
user's tool calls implicitly used the operator's cached OAuth token,
so docs were created in the operator's Drive and the retrofit Apps
Script Web App (deployed `access: MYSELF`) was unusable for anyone
but the operator.

### New: `gdocs_setup_apps_script` MCP tool

One-shot setup for the per-user Apps Script Web App needed by
`gdocs_tab_existing_doc` (the lossless content-move path). Run once
per user; idempotent on retry (resumes from the last successful
step). Stdio mode keeps calling the v1.0 local CLI; HTTP mode
deploys a Web App into the calling user's Drive.

### Cloud architecture: "Shape C"

- **FastMCP's `GoogleProvider`** handles claude.ai connector auth
  (identity-only `openid email` scopes, but `valid_scopes` advertises
  the full Workspace union so consent grants Docs/Drive/Apps Script
  at the same time)
- **Separate auth-code flow we own** (`/oauth/google/api/callback`)
  obtains tokens we can actually use for Google API calls
- **Per-user state** in SQLite on the Fly volume, keyed by Google
  `sub`
- **Per-user lock on refresh** so two concurrent tool calls don't
  rotate each other's refresh_token

Why not just rely on `GoogleProvider` for the API tokens too: the
upstream Google tokens it holds live in private attributes
(`_upstream_token_store`, no public getter, no API contract). The
MCP spec blesses two-flow designs in the "URL Mode Elicitation for
OAuth Flows" pattern; production reference is
[`taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp`](https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp).

### New env vars (HTTP deploy)

Required when running the Fly server with the new auth wiring:

- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_BASE_URL` — public HTTPS hostname of the deployment
  (e.g. `https://my-app.fly.dev`). Must exactly match the actual URL
  or claude.ai's connector OAuth discovery silently fails.
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS_JSON` — full OAuth client JSON inline,
  or `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS_PATH` pointing at a file.
- `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` (already required) — reused as the HMAC signing
  key for the OAuth state parameter.

Auto-set by `configure_auth_for_http`:
`OAUTHLIB_RELAX_TOKEN_SCOPE=1` (so partial-grant consents don't
crash the OAuth callback).

### Breaking: existing claude.ai connector users must reconnect

The OAuth scope set is changing. Existing connector connections need
to be disconnected + reconnected in claude.ai's connector settings to
pick up the new scopes.

### Internal modules added

- `user_store.py` — SQLite per-user state (WAL mode, per-path init
  guard, merge-semantics on save, typo-rejection)
- `oauth_state.py` — HMAC-signed, single-use state-param for OAuth
  callback (CSRF + replay protection)
- `oauth_google.py` — `google_auth_oauthlib.Flow` setup, callback
  code-exchange, GoogleProvider activation
- `credentials.py` — `get_credentials_for_user(sub)` with per-user
  refresh lock, `invalid_grant` → `NeedsReauthError` mapping
- `setup_apps_script_for_user` — cloud-side variant of
  `setup_apps_script_auto` using `user_store` as the per-user ledger

### Production bug fix in user_store

The concurrent-writes test surfaced a real `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`
race that `busy_timeout` doesn't mitigate. Fixed via per-path init
guard under `threading.Lock` — would have fired on Fly the moment
two cloud users finished OAuth simultaneously.

### Tests

+49 unit tests across the v1.1 modules:
`test_user_store.py` (13), `test_oauth_state.py` (12),
`test_oauth_google.py` (13), `test_credentials.py` (11),
`test_setup_apps_script_for_user.py` (9),
`test_phase6_consumer_branching.py` (7),
`test_configure_auth_for_http.py` (9). Total: 158 unit + 4 live.

### Dependencies

- `fastmcp>=2.13` (was `>=2.0`) — `GoogleProvider` + `valid_scopes` +
  `_default_scope_str` post-init patch all require 2.13+.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-18

**Fixed: orphan Apps Script projects on setup retry.**

`setup-apps-script-auto` now persists per-step state to
`~/.google-docs-mcp/setup-state.json`. If any step in the 4-step
pipeline (create project → push files → create version → deploy webapp)
fails, the next retry resumes from the first incomplete step instead
of creating a second Apps Script project in the user's Drive.

Handles three resume scenarios:
- Same content + same impersonate user → resume from first incomplete step
- Edited `restructure.gs` (different content hash) → start fresh
- User manually deleted the script in Drive (cached script_id 404s) →
  detect and start fresh

Caught preventively via the v1.0 architecture-review pass. Without the
ledger, a user retrying after a flaky network would have accumulated
"ghost scripts" requiring manual Drive cleanup.

+6 unit tests in `tests/unit/test_setup_idempotency.py` covering cold
start, mid-step crash + resume, content-change reset, and manual-delete
recovery. Total tests: 78 unit + 4 live.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-18

First stable release.

**Tool surface (18 tools, all `gdocs_`-prefixed):**

- Create / convert / retrofit: `gdocs_make_tabbed_doc`, `gdocs_tab_existing_doc`, `gdocs_preview_tab_split`
- Edit tabs: `gdocs_add_tabs`, `gdocs_append_to_tab`, `gdocs_rename_tab`, `gdocs_delete_tab`, `gdocs_set_tab_icons`, `gdocs_replace_all_text`
- Read: `gdocs_get_doc_outline`, `gdocs_read_doc`, `gdocs_get_tab_url`
- Search / manage: `gdocs_find_doc_by_title`, `gdocs_trash_file`, `gdocs_untrash_file`, `gdocs_move_to_folder`
- Cloud-chat support: `gdocs_get_signed_upload_url`
- Server identity: `gdocs_server_info`

**Notable progression since pre-1.0 alpha:**

- Native Google Docs Tabs (Oct 2024 sidebar feature) — every tool operates at the tab level, not just outline headings.
- Both stdio (Claude Desktop / Code) and remote HTTP (claude.ai via Fly.io) transports.
- Apps Script Web App setup automated via `setup-apps-script-auto` CLI — collapses the 6-step UI dance into one OAuth consent. Opt-in `--auth-mode=service-account` adds Domain-Wide Delegation for Workspace users wanting truly headless setup.
- Signed-URL upload flow (`gdocs_get_signed_upload_url`) for claude.ai's sandbox — bypasses the bytes-via-tool-args size limit AND the Drive-connector .docx corruption issue.
- Soft-failure contracts on every mutate operation: 404 / 403 / `app_not_authorized` return as data, never raised. Batch operations skip-and-continue.
- Retrofit injects synthetic Heading 1s into styled `.docx` files with no headings (table-banner sections, etc.). Unicode-normalized + whitespace-collapsed + run-fragmentation-tolerant matching.
- 76 tests (72 unit + 4 live integration). CI runs on every push/PR across Python 3.10–3.13.
- Deploy script (`deploy.sh`) gates Fly.io deploys on local unit-test pass.
- `gas_deploy/` sub-package: clean boundary around Apps Script REST plumbing — extractable as a standalone package if a second consumer ever appears.

**Known limitations** (see README):

- `setActiveTab` (persistent default-tab setting) not exposed. Use `gdocs_get_tab_url` for per-link deep linking instead — covers the common case.
- Drive's converter 500s on `.docx` files using `<w:sym w:char="00A0"/>` for NBSP. Our retrofit handles this construct correctly in-memory; the limitation is purely Drive's. Use the literal `\xa0` character inside `<w:t>` (the form Word actually produces) instead.
- Per-tab headers/footers not supported. Tabs render as continuous scroll in the Docs UI; page headers only matter for paginated PDF export.
