"""``as_install_edit_trigger`` — reactive ``onEdit`` automation for Sheets.

ROADMAP_SPECS #8 (the reactive/event-trigger half). A *use-case* tool
layered on the PR-Δ7 bound-script generator primitive
(``as_generate_bound_script`` / ``services/apps_script/api.py``). Where
the primitive is generic ("here's a ``.gs`` body + manifest, deploy it
bound to this container") and ``sheet_dashboard`` encodes the *time*-driven
pattern, THIS tool encodes the *event*-driven one: install an
**installable ``onEdit`` trigger** bound to a Google Sheet that runs a
caller-supplied handler whenever a user edits the spreadsheet — validating
input, stamping an audit cell, mirroring a change, etc. — on Google's
infrastructure, with no Claude call in the loop after the install.

**Installable, not simple.** A *simple* trigger is just a function named
``onEdit(e)`` — it runs in a restricted, no-auth context and cannot call
services that need authorization. This tool installs an **installable**
trigger via ``ScriptApp.newTrigger(handler).forSpreadsheet(id).onEdit()
.create()``. Installable triggers run with the installing user's full
authorization, so the handler can do real work (write other ranges, call
other Google services). That power is exactly why an installable trigger
requires the ``script.scriptapp`` oauthScope in the generated script's
manifest (see "Manifest reality" below) — the same scope
``sheet_dashboard``'s time trigger needs.

**Composition, not reimplementation.** The deploy machinery is reused
verbatim from the #138 primitive's ``api.py``:

  * ``build_manifest`` — to derive the manifest (we hand it the
    ``script.scriptapp`` scope via ``oauth_scopes`` since an installable
    ``onEdit`` trigger needs it; the trigger itself is wired in code, not
    declared in the manifest).
  * ``create_bound_project`` → ``set_project_content`` →
    ``create_deployment`` — the same create/push/deploy sequence the
    primitive orchestrates. We bind directly to the Sheet ID (no Drive
    mimeType round-trip — this tool only ever targets a Sheet).

This module's OWN contribution is the ``.gs`` *script-body synthesis* —
stitching the caller's ``handler_function_body`` together with a generated
``installTrigger()`` that wires a deduplicated ``onEdit`` trigger via
``ScriptApp.newTrigger(handler).forSpreadsheet(sheetId).onEdit().create()``
— plus the handler-name extraction and parameter validation. None of the
REST plumbing is duplicated.

**Manifest reality (inherited from #138).** ``onEdit`` triggers are NOT an
``appsscript.json`` field — they're created in code via
``ScriptApp.newTrigger(handler).forSpreadsheet(id).onEdit().create()``. The
manifest's only job for an installable trigger is to declare the
``script.scriptapp`` oauthScope so the generated code is authorized to
install it. We pass that scope to ``build_manifest`` via ``oauth_scopes``
(the manifest can't declare the trigger itself — that's the #138
manifest-reality finding).

**The trigger-activation caveat — read this (same as sheet_dashboard).**
An *installable* trigger only comes into existence when
``installTrigger()`` actually *runs*. Deploying the script does NOT auto-run
it (the deploy step publishes code; it doesn't execute functions), and the
Apps Script REST API has no endpoint to create an installable trigger
remotely. So this tool *wires* the trigger into the deployed script but
does NOT make it live. The return payload is HONEST: ``trigger_active`` is
``False`` and ``activation_required`` is ``True`` with the one-step
instruction (open the script editor → run ``installTrigger`` once →
authorize). After that single run the ``onEdit`` reaction fires forever on
every edit. We do NOT claim the automation is live on return.

    """Install a reactive ``onEdit`` automation into a Google Sheet.

    Deploys a *bound* Apps Script into the Sheet that runs your
    ``handler_function_body`` whenever the spreadsheet is edited, via an
    **installable** ``onEdit`` trigger
    (``ScriptApp.newTrigger(handler).forSpreadsheet(id).onEdit().create()``).
    The handler receives the standard Apps Script edit event object ``e``
    (``e.range``, ``e.value``, ``e.oldValue``, ``e.source``, …) so it can
    react to exactly what changed — validate the edit, stamp a
    last-modified cell, mirror the value elsewhere, etc. Once activated it
    runs on Google's infrastructure with NO Claude call in the loop. This
    composes the generic bound-script primitive
    (``as_generate_bound_script``) for one concrete, common pattern.

    USE WHEN: the user wants a Sheet to REACT to edits automatically —
    "timestamp column A whenever a row changes", "validate that the status
    cell is one of the allowed values", "log every edit to an audit tab".
    For a ONE-OFF write, just use ``gsheets_write_range`` (no script
    needed). For a SCHEDULED (time-driven) automation use
    ``as_install_sheet_dashboard``; for a custom ``=FUNCTION()`` use
    ``as_install_custom_function``.

    INSTALLABLE vs SIMPLE trigger: this installs an *installable* trigger,
    which runs with your full authorization — so the handler can call other
    Google services and write other ranges. (A *simple* ``onEdit`` — just a
    function named ``onEdit`` — runs in a restricted no-auth context and
    can't do that.) The power of an installable trigger is why the
    generated script's manifest declares the ``script.scriptapp`` scope.

    IMPORTANT — activation is a required one-time step (same as
    ``as_install_sheet_dashboard``). An *installable* trigger only exists
    once its installer runs, and deploying a script does NOT run it (and the
    Apps Script REST API can't create the trigger remotely). So this tool
    WIRES the trigger into the deployed script but the reaction is NOT live
    yet on return. To activate: open the returned ``project_url``, run the
    ``installTrigger`` function once (the editor's Run button), and approve
    the authorization prompt. After that single run the ``onEdit`` reaction
    fires on every edit. The return payload says so explicitly —
    ``trigger_active`` is ``False`` and ``activation_required`` is ``True``
    with the step spelled out. Do not tell the user their Sheet is already
    reacting to edits until they've run ``installTrigger`` once.

    Args:
        sheet_id: Drive ID of the Google Sheet to install the automation
            into (the ID part of the Sheet's URL). The bound script + the
            ``onEdit`` trigger are attached to THIS Sheet.
        handler_function_body: the ``.gs`` source for the edit handler as a
            NAMED function declaration, e.g.
            ``"function onSheetEdit(e) { /* react to e.range */ }"``. Claude
            authors this — it's the work that runs on each edit. Its
            declared name becomes the trigger handler. Required; empty /
            unnamed bodies are rejected. The function should accept the
            edit event parameter (conventionally ``e``).
        handler_note: OPTIONAL human note rendered as a leading comment in
            the generated script (documents the reaction's intent for
            anyone who opens the editor). Does not affect behavior.
        name: OPTIONAL title for the new Apps Script project. Defaults to a
            generated edit-trigger name.
        on_conflict: what to do when an onEdit automation from THIS tool
            already exists on this Sheet. "new" (the default) always
            installs a fresh one (which can leave duplicate reactions);
            "replace" uninstalls the prior install(s) on this Sheet first
            (no duplicate, no orphan); "skip" returns the existing install
            unchanged instead of adding a duplicate. Keyed by (this tool,
            this container) via appscriptly's automation ledger; the
            response adds ``reused_existing`` / ``replaced_count``.

    Returns:
        ``{script_id, deployment_id, sheet_id, trigger_type,
        trigger_handler, project_url, trigger_active, activation_required,
        activation_instructions}``. ``trigger_type`` is ``"onEdit"``.
        ``trigger_handler`` is the parsed handler-function name the trigger
        drives. ``project_url`` deep-links to the script editor.
        ``trigger_active`` is ``False`` and ``activation_required`` is
        ``True`` on a successful deploy — the trigger is wired but needs a
        one-time ``installTrigger`` run (see the activation note above);
        ``activation_instructions`` is the literal step.

    Raises:
        ToolError: an empty / unnamed ``handler_function_body`` (rejected
            before any API call), or any Apps Script / Drive API error —
            the standard decorator envelope renders these as user-facing
            ``ToolError``.

    Choreography: get ``sheet_id`` from the user's URL, from a prior
    ``gsheets_create_spreadsheet`` call, or from
    ``gdocs_find_doc_by_title``. After this returns, point the user at
    ``project_url`` to run ``installTrigger`` once — that's the only manual
    step. (The Apps Script scopes are in the baseline grant, so most users
    won't see a second OAuth consent for the deploy itself; the in-editor
    ``installTrigger`` run has its own one-time authorization prompt for the
    trigger scope.)
